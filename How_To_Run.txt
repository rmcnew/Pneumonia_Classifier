Pneumonia_Classifier was developed using Python 3.5.3 on Linux.

It should be able to run under on other platforms that support Python 3, but it has not been tested exhaustively.

These instructions assume that you have little to no Python background, but should enable you to get the Pneumonia_Classifier running.

0.  Download or 'git clone' Pneumonia_Classifier from GitHub.

Go to 'https://github.com/rmcnew/Pneumonia_Classifier' and click the "Clone or Download" button and then click download Zip.  Unzip the resulting file.

OR

If you have git installed, run 'git clone https://github.com/rmcnew/Pneumonia_Classifier.git'

1.  Install Python 3 on your platform.

If you are using Linux or macOS, there's a good chance that you might have Python already installed.  Open a terminal
and try running "python3 --version".  If you are on another platform, point your web browser to https://www.python.org,
download the latest release for your platform and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

2.  Install virtualenv.

virtualenv is a localized Python package management system that allows Python packages to be installed locally for
Python projects.    Follow the virtualenv installation instructions at
https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/

3.  Create a virtualenv environment

In the Pneumonia_Classifier directory from step 0, run the following command:

python3 -m venv .venv

This will create an empty virtualenv environment in the ".venv" directory.  This allows the Pneumonia_Classifier Python requirements to be installed locally.

4.  Activate the virtualenv environment

In the Pneumonia_Classifier directory, run the following command:

source .venv/bin/activate

This should prepend "(.venv)" to your shell prompt, letting you know that you are in the virtualenv.

5.  Install Python requirements

While inside the virtualenv environment and in the Pneumonia_Classifier directory, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the Python packages needed to run Pneumonia_Classifer in the virtualenv.

6.  Run Pneumonia_Classifer scripts (note that you will need a machine with 16 GB RAM or more for the scripts to run in a reasonable amount of time).

python pneumonia_classifier.py   

will run the current main function of pneumonia_classifier.py.  By default this will run the pneumonia_classifier_model.m5 against the Validate dataset subset.  You can edit the last few lines of pneumonia_classifier.py to change what action is performed.  This includes:  1) Training the model from scratch, 2) Training the current model more, 3) Running the pneumonia_classifier_model.m5 against the Test dataset subset, and 4) Running the pneumonia_classifier_model.m5 against the Validate dataset subset.

python predict_xray.py XRAY_IMAGE_FILE

where XRAY_IMAGE_FILE is an arbitrary chest X-ray image file.  This will run the pneumonia_classifier_model.m5 against the XRAY_IMAGE_FILE that you provide.  You can use X-ray images from the Validate dataset subset that are found in the dataset/validate directories.  For example:

python predict_xray.py ./dataset/validate/NORMAL/NORMAL2-IM-1431-0001.jpeg

OR

python predict_xray.py ./dataset/validate/PNEUMONIA/person1949_bacteria_4880.jpeg


Images that are not part of the dataset should also work.  Some sample chest X-ray images are in the other_xrays directory.
