# Pneumonia_Classifier
A machine learning image classifier for pediatric chest X-rays to help detect pneumonia.  Created for Intelligent Systems graduate school class.

Implemented as a [Google Colaboratory Jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rmcnew/Pneumonia_Classifier/blob/master/Pneumonia_Classifier.ipynb)

There is also a non-Colaboratory version implemented as Python scripts:  *pneumonia_classifier.py* and *predict_xray.py*.  See How_To_Run.txt for instructions on non-Colaboratory setup.
